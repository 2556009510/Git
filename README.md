<br>cd A ·········································`进入文件夹A`
<br>echo 'hello' > a.txt ············`创建a.txt，并打印内容hello（注意空格）`
<br>cat a.txt ·································`显示a.txt内容`
<br>cp a.txt b.txt ························`复制a.txt，并命名为b.txt`
<br>ls .. ···········································`返回上一个目录`
<br>
<br>move b.txt ../b.txt 
<br>mv b.txt ../b.txt ····················`将b.txt移出该文件夹`

<br>
<br>rm a.txt ··································`删除`
<br>
